# internet-protocol-translation

A program, which main task is to **calculate** and **display** key parameters of a given IP address, i.e.
subnet mask, broadcast address, number of possible hosts along with its binary interpretation. 

Another function is calculating IP addresses of different subnets created in a given network and
displaying mentioned earlier parameters for them as well.

The program itself will be completely altered - both the structure and the way it works.
